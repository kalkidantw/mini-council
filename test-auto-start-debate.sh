echo "🎯 Auto-Start Features:"
echo "======================"
echo "✅ 1. Immediate Start:"
echo "   • Debate begins as soon as page loads"
echo "   • No manual triggers or button clicks required"
echo "   • Works with or without dilemma ID in URL"

echo "✅ 2. Fallback Handling:"
echo "   • When no dilemma ID provided, uses fallback dilemma"
echo "   • Auto-starts debate with default dilemma (ID: 1)"
echo "   • Graceful error handling if API fails"
echo ""
echo "✅ 3. Optimized Timing:"
echo "   • Reduced animation delays (25ms instead of 50ms)"
echo "   • Faster transcript scrolling (50ms instead of 100ms)"
echo "   • Quicker modal appearance (1s instead of 2s)"
echo "   • Immediate loading states and feedback"
echo ""
echo "✅ 4. Enhanced Loading States:"
echo "   • Clear loading indicators during debate preparation"
echo "   • Animated loading states with descriptive text"
echo "   • Immediate visual feedback when debate starts"

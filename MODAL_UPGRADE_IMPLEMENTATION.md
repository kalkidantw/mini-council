- **Agreement/disagreement detection** to show which personas aligned or differed

---

## üìã Modal Structure

### **1. ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced Perspective Section**
- **Purpose**: Neutral blend of all viewpoints
- **Content**: Comprehensive analysis that acknowledges emotional, logical, and practical considerations
- **Tone**: Balanced and objective, recognizing the value of each perspective

**Example Content:**
```
After carefully considering all perspectives in your internal debate, the balanced view recognizes that this decision involves both emotional and practical considerations. Your Heart emphasizes the importance of following your feelings and what brings you genuine happiness, while Logic focuses on the concrete facts, consequences, and long-term implications. Shadow reminds us to be realistic about potential risks and protect your interests.
```

### **2. ‚úÖ Final Decision Section**
- **Purpose**: One clear, actionable conclusion
- **Logic**: Analyzes sentiment across all three personas to determine majority stance
- **Output**: Decisive "Yes", "No", or "Proceed with caution" recommendation

**Decision Logic:**
```javascript
// Analyzes positive/negative sentiment in each persona's opinion
const positiveWords = ["should", "recommend", "good", "beneficial", "positive", "proceed", "go ahead", "yes"];
const negativeWords = ["shouldn't", "avoid", "bad", "risky", "negative", "don't", "no", "reconsider"];

// Determines overall decision based on majority
if (positiveCount >= 2) {
  return "Yes, you should proceed with this decision...";
} else if (negativeCount >= 2) {
  return "No, you should reconsider this decision...";
} else {
  return "Proceed with caution...";
}
```

**Example Outputs:**
- ‚úÖ **"Yes, you should proceed with this decision. The majority of your internal voices support this choice..."**
- ‚ùå **"No, you should reconsider this decision. Your internal voices have identified significant concerns..."**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Proceed with caution. While there are valid reasons to move forward, ensure you address the concerns..."**

### **3. üìä Opinion Summary Section**
- **Purpose**: Show agreement/disagreement patterns among personas
- **Analysis**: Detects which personas aligned or differed in their conclusions
- **Display**: Clear summary + individual persona opinions with emojis

**Agreement Patterns Detected:**
- **All three agreed** - "All three voices agreed that this is the right choice..."
- **All three disagreed** - "All three voices expressed concerns about this decision..."
- **Heart & Logic agreed** - "Heart and Logic agreed on the best approach, while Shadow remained neutral..."
- **Heart & Shadow agreed** - "Heart and Shadow found common ground, while Logic took a more measured stance..."
- **Logic & Shadow agreed** - "Logic and Shadow agreed on the practical considerations, while Heart had a different emotional perspective..."
- **All different** - "Each voice had a distinct perspective on this decision..."

**Visual Display:**
```
üìä Opinion Summary
Each voice had a distinct perspective on this decision...

‚ù§Ô∏è Heart: You should follow your heart and do what feels right.
üß† Logic: Consider the facts and consequences carefully before deciding.
üòà Shadow: Be realistic about the risks and protect yourself.
```

### **4. üìù Disclaimer Footer**
- **Content**: "This is AI-generated and not a substitute for professional advice. Always check facts and consult a licensed expert if needed."
- **Styling**: Small, italic text with subtle color
- **Purpose**: Legal compliance and user safety

### **Expected Results:**
- Modal appears automatically when debate ends

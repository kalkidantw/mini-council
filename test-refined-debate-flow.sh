echo "üó£Ô∏è Testing Refined Debate Flow - 10-11 Turns with Natural Reactions"
echo "=================================================================="

echo "üéØ Refined Debate Flow Goals:"
echo "============================"
echo "‚úÖ 1. Exactly 10-11 total back-and-forth turns"
echo "‚úÖ 2. Each persona response: 1-3 sentences max"
echo "‚úÖ 3. Natural reactions: agreement/disagreement"
echo "‚úÖ 4. Referencing previous statements"
echo "‚úÖ 5. Challenging or adding to each other's points"
echo "‚úÖ 6. Genuine human debate feel - spontaneous and responsive"
echo "‚úÖ 7. Total reading duration within ~80 seconds"
echo ""

echo "üîß Technical Changes Applied:"
echo "============================"
echo "Turn Control:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Fixed total messages: 10-11 (was 9-11)"

echo "  ‚Ä¢ Fallback speaker selection for reliability"
echo ""
echo "Speaker Selection:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Early conversation (turns 1-3): Strong boost for under-represented"

echo "  ‚Ä¢ Contrasting perspectives: Boost for Heart vs Logic, Shadow vs others"
echo ""
echo "Message Generation:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Enhanced prompts for natural reactions"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Explicit instruction to reference previous statements"

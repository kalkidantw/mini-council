echo "🔁 Testing 11-Message Guarantee (Budget-Adjusted)"
echo "================================================"

echo "🎯 11-Message Guarantee Requirements:"
echo "===================================="
echo "✅ 1. Always Generate Exactly 11 Messages"
echo "   • Not per persona - total debate messages"
echo "   • Natural back-and-forth distribution"
echo "   • Heart → Shadow → Logic → Heart pattern"
echo ""
echo "✅ 2. Budget-Adjusted Token Management"
echo "   • Slightly increased token cap for 11 messages"
echo "   • Cost-effective phrasing: 2-3 sentences max"
echo "   • ~15-25 tokens per message"
echo "   • Preserve 80s timing limit"
echo ""
echo "✅ 3. Natural Turn Distribution"
echo "   • Even distribution across personas"
echo "   • Back-and-forth conversation flow"
echo "   • No rigid turn order"
echo "   • Volume-based participation control"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Technical Implementation:"
echo "==========================="
echo "Message Count Fix:"
echo "  • totalMessages: 10-11 → 11 (always exactly)"
echo "  • maxAttempts: totalMessages * 2 → totalMessages * 3"
echo "  • Force completion logic for guaranteed 11 messages"
echo ""
echo "Token Budget Optimization:"
echo "  • Volume 80%+: 85 → 75 tokens (2-3 sentences)"
echo "  • Volume 50%+: 65 → 55 tokens (1-2 sentences)"
echo "  • Volume 20%+: 45 → 40 tokens (1 sentence)"
echo "  • Volume <20%: 35 → 30 tokens (brief reaction)"
echo ""
echo "Fallback Logic Enhancement:"
echo "  • Better error handling for failed message generation"
echo "  • Force completion when < 11 messages"
echo "  • Choose lowest turn count personas for balance"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "===================="
echo "Message Generation:"
echo "  • Always exactly 11 total messages"
echo "  • Natural conversation flow"
echo "  • Even distribution across personas"
echo "  • Back-and-forth interaction"
echo ""
echo "Cost Management:"
echo "  • Optimized token usage per message"

echo "   • Always generates exactly 11 messages"
echo "   • No early termination due to budget"
echo "   • Consistent message count across debates"
echo "   • Proper fallback when generation fails"
echo ""
echo "✅ Turn Distribution Verification:"
echo "   • Even distribution across personas"
echo "   • Natural back-and-forth flow"

echo ""
echo "✅ Timing Verification:"
echo "   • Total duration within 80s limit"
echo "   • Natural reading speed maintained"
echo "   • Proper message timing and flow"
echo ""

echo "📱 Testing Instructions:"
echo "======================="
echo "1. Start Multiple Debates:"
echo "   • Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/debate"
echo "   • Start debates with different dilemmas"
echo "   • Verify each generates exactly 11 messages"
echo ""
echo "2. Check Console Logs:"
echo "   • Look for: '🎯 Target: 11 total messages'"
echo "   • Verify: '✅ Generated 11 messages'"
echo "   • Check turn distribution logs"
echo "   • Monitor token usage tracking"
echo ""
echo "3. Volume Control Testing:"
echo "   • Test with different volume levels"
echo "   • Verify 11 messages regardless of volumes"
echo "   • Check natural distribution patterns"
echo ""
echo "4. Cost Monitoring:"
echo "   • Check token usage in console"
echo "   • Verify efficient token consumption"
echo "   • Monitor total debate cost"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Expected Console Output:"
echo "=========================="
echo "Message Generation:"
echo "🎯 Target: 11 total messages for refined human-like reactive flow"
echo "💬 [Persona] speaks at [time]s (vol: [X]%): '[message preview]...'"
echo "✅ Generated 11 messages with human-like reactive flow"
echo ""
echo "Turn Distribution:"
echo "📊 Final turn count: Heart(X), Logic(Y), Shadow(Z)"
echo "📈 Turn distribution vs volume: Heart(X/100%), Logic(Y/100%), Shadow(Z/100%)"
echo ""
echo "Cost Tracking:"
echo "💰 Token usage: [total_tokens] tokens"
echo "💵 Estimated cost: $[amount]"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Before vs After Comparison:"
echo "============================="
echo "Before (Inconsistent):"
echo "  • Message count: 4-6 messages (variable)"
echo "  • Early termination due to budget"
echo "  • Inconsistent debate length"
echo "  • Poor user experience"
echo ""
echo "After (Guaranteed):"
echo "  • Message count: Always exactly 11"
echo "  • Budget-adjusted token management"
echo "  • Consistent debate experience"
echo "  • Enhanced user engagement"
echo ""

echo "💰 Cost Management Strategy:"

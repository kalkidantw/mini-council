## 🔍 Debugging

### Common Issues
1. **Persona not speaking**: Check system prompts
2. **Rigid turn-taking**: Verify conversation flow settings
3. **Token limits**: Monitor usage in console logs
4. **Timing issues**: Check timestamp calculations

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Watch debate generation
tail -f your-backend-log-file | grep -E '(🎭|🤖|✅|📊)'

# Monitor token usage
tail -f your-backend-log-file | grep -E '(📊|💰|📈)'
```

## 🚀 Integration

### Frontend Usage
The debate messages can be used to:

- Show real-time conversation flow

### Database Storage
Each message is saved to the Responses table with:
- `persona`: Which persona spoke
- `transcript`: The message content
- `timestamp`: Database timestamp
- `debate_timestamp`: Debate timing (seconds)

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test (General)
```bash
# Make sure your backend is running on localhost:3001
./test-debate-route.sh
```

### Quick Test (OpenAI Implementation)
```bash
# Test specifically for OpenAI implementation
./test-openai-fix.sh
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Create a dilemma:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/dilemma \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Should I drop my Tuesday class?"}'
```

2. **Test the respond route (replace <DILEMMA_ID> with actual ID):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/debate/<DILEMMA_ID>/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dummy": "data"}'
```

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file contains:

```ini
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## 🔧 Optional Supabase Schema Fix

If you're still getting user_id constraint errors, you can make it optional in Supabase:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Table Editor → Responses table
3. Edit the `user_id` column
4. Remove the NOT NULL constraint
5. Save changes

## 📊 Expected Response Format

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "responses": [
    {
      "persona": "Heart",
      "transcript": "As your Heart, I feel..."
    },
    {
      "persona": "Logic", 
      "transcript": "From a logical perspective..."
    },
    {
      "persona": "Shadow",
      "transcript": "Let me be honest with you..."
    }
  ],
  "dilemmaId": "your-uuid-here",
  "dilemmaPrompt": "Should I drop my Tuesday class?"
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Dilemma not found",
  "searchedId": "your-uuid-here"
}
```

## 🔍 Console Logs to Watch For

When the route is working correctly, you should see these logs:

```
🤖 Using OpenAI model: gpt-4o-mini for persona: Heart
📝 Generating response for Heart with 2 messages
✅ Successfully generated Heart response (156 characters)
🤖 Using OpenAI model: gpt-4o-mini for persona: Logic
📝 Generating response for Logic with 2 messages
✅ Successfully generated Logic response (142 characters)
🤖 Using OpenAI model: gpt-4o-mini for persona: Shadow
📝 Generating response for Shadow with 2 messages
✅ Successfully generated Shadow response (178 characters)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the route with the provided scripts
2. Check the console logs for detailed debugging info
3. Verify the OpenAI model logs show `gpt-4o-mini`
4. If still having issues, check your environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

The route should now work properly with OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model and provide detailed error information if something goes wrong!

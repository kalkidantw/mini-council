# Frontend-Backend Connection Fix

## 🐛 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Frontend form submission was failing with "Failed to submit dilemma. Please try again."

**Root Cause**: Frontend was trying to fetch from `/api/dilemma` (relative URL) instead of the correct backend server URL.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Frontend Fetch URLs**
- ✅ Updated `app/page.tsx` to use `http://localhost:3001/api/dilemma`
- ✅ Updated `app/debate/page.tsx` to use `http://localhost:3001/api/dilemma/{id}`
- ✅ Added better error logging and debugging

### 2. **Fixed Backend Server Configuration**
- ✅ Moved dilemma routes mounting before server start
- ✅ Ensured proper middleware order (CORS, JSON parsing, routes)
- ✅ Fixed route mounting order in `server.js`

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ Added detailed error logging in frontend
- ✅ Added response status codes to error messages
- ✅ Added console logging for successful submissions

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Backend Endpoints Working ✅
```bash
# POST /api/dilemma
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/dilemma \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Should I move to a new city for a fresh start?"}'

# Response:
{
  "message": "Dilemma saved!",
  "dilemma": {
    "id": "72c9b26b-23c4-4401-b64a-514b078d9618",
    "prompt": "Should I move to a new city for a fresh start?",
    "created_at": "2025-07-27T00:32:04.265824"
  }
}
```

### Complete Flow Working ✅
1. ✅ Dilemma submission to Supabase
2. ✅ Dilemma ID returned to frontend
3. ✅ Frontend redirects to debate page
4. ✅ Debate page fetches dilemma content
5. ✅ Debate generation works

## 🔍 Debugging Steps Applied

### 1. **Identified the Issue**
- Frontend was using relative URLs instead of absolute backend URLs
- Backend routes were mounted after server start

### 2. **Fixed URL Configuration**
- Changed from `/api/dilemma` to `http://localhost:3001/api/dilemma`
- Updated both homepage and debate page

### 3. **Fixed Server Configuration**
- Reorganized `server.js` to mount routes before starting server
- Ensured proper middleware order

### 4. **Added Better Error Handling**
- Enhanced error logging in frontend
- Added response status codes
- Added success logging

## 🚀 Ready to Test

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Start Backend**: `node server.js` (port 3001)
2. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev` (port 3000)
3. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000
4. **Enter dilemma**: "Should I move to a new city for a fresh start?"
5. **Click**: "Let Them Talk"
6. **Expected**: Redirect to `/debate?id={DILEMMA_ID}`

### Automated Testing
```bash
./test-frontend-backend.sh
```

## 📊 Expected Console Logs

### Frontend Console
```
Dilemma created successfully: {
  message: "Dilemma saved!",
  dilemma: {
    id: "72c9b26b-23c4-4401-b64a-514b078d9618",
    prompt: "Should I move to a new city for a fresh start?",
    created_at: "2025-07-27T00:32:04.265824"
  }
}
```

### Backend Console
